    <P>I was born on April 24,2002 in Greenbrae, California. I have grown up with my brother,
        Kyle, who is two years older than me, my mom and my dad in Sun Valley live above a park called
        Sun Valley Park and one time when I was young, I fell off of a swing and directly into
        a puddle that was below the swing. I also have a cat named Jess, who is 3 years old.</P>
