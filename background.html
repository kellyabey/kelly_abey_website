    <p>I was born on April 24,2002 in Greenbrae, California. I have grown up with my brother,
        Kyle, who is two years older than me, my mom and my dad in Sun Valley live above a park called
        Sun Valley Park and one time when I was young, I fell off of a swing and directly into
        a puddle that was below the swing. I also have a cat named Jess, who is 3 years old.</p>
    <p>I went to Sun Valley Elementary School, Davidson Midle School, and I currently attend San Rafael High School. Next year, I plan on going to college, with my top choices being UC Santa Cruz, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p>
